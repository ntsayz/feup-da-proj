This application is designed to provide routing algorithms for ocean shipping and urban deliveries. It aims to optimize the delivery routes and minimize transportation costs. The algorithms implemented in this application can be used to efficiently plan the transportation of goods and optimize the delivery process.\hypertarget{index_features_sec}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{index_features_sec}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Nearest Neighbor TSP Algorithm\+: This algorithm approximates the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by selecting the nearest unvisited neighbor at each step to construct a tour.
\item Greedy 2-\/opt TSP Algorithm\+: This algorithm improves an initial tour by iteratively swapping pairs of edges to reduce the total distance.
\item Triangular Approximation Algorithm\+: This algorithm creates a minimum spanning tree (MST) and traverses it to construct an approximate TSP tour. It uses the triangular inequality property to estimate the distances.
\item Backtracking TSP Algorithm\+: This algorithm exhaustively explores all possible paths using a backtracking approach to find the optimal TSP tour.
